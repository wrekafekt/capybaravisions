        <h1>Capybara Visions Roadmap</h1>

        <h2>1. State of the Project Update</h2>
        <p>We're thrilled to announce that 21% of our unique 9999 editions have been minted. Each edition is crafted with precision, reflecting the essence and uniqueness of the Capybara Visions project. We're heading towards a vibrant community-driven ecosystem, and we're excited for what's to come!</p>

        <h2>2. Loyal Holder Rewards</h2>
        <p>Our early adopters hold a special place in our hearts. As a token of our appreciation, we're releasing an exclusive edition Capybara Vision artwork. Plus, as we roll out new projects and events, our first supporters will get a privileged front-row experience, ensuring they're always ahead of the curve.</p>

        <h2>3. Bulk Holder Incentives</h2>
        <p>For those holding a significant amount of Capybara Visions, we've designed a suite of benefits. Introducing a burn-to-mint mechanism for our upcoming project: holders can opt to burn a certain number of Capybara Visions to mint exclusive items in our next venture. The higher the burn, the rarer the item. This creates value on both fronts, making the original editions even more scarce and prized.</p>

        <h2>4. Booster Sales</h2>
        <p>Get ready to amplify your collection! Our booster sales are designed to reward bulk purchases without diluting value. Early holders get an exclusive window to make purchases before everyone else. Plus, our trade-in option ensures original investments are respected and preserved.</p>

        <h2>5. Community Building & Engagement</h2>
        <p>Community is the core of Capybara Visions. Dive into our monthly AMAs where we address your queries and share insights. But that's not all! We're lining up collaborations with renowned projects and artists, bringing new dimensions to the table. Our virtual events, ranging from gallery viewings to interactive sessions, are curated to foster engagement and camaraderie.</p>

        <h2>6. Continuous Updates & Transparency</h2>
        <p>We believe in transparent and open communication. Regular updates will be rolled out, ensuring everyone is aligned with our progress, changes, and news. We're here for the long haul, and we're committed to building a legacy built on trust and shared growth.</p>

        <h2>7. Future Visions</h2>
        <p>The horizon of Capybara Visions is vast and filled with possibilities. While we're only revealing snippets for now, know that our journey is expansive, intertwining this project with future endeavors in exciting ways. Stay tuned as the story unfolds!</p>
